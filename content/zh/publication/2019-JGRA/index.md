Tippett (2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JD029345) provides an insightful comment on the theoretical consideration part of Yang et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JD028002), which studied the relationship between probabilistic and deterministic skills in dynamical seasonal climate prediction. The author connects the theoretical finding of Yang et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JD028002) with some previous studies on this topic and further provide a simple‐form approximation to the derived theoretical relation in Yang et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JD028002). However, the author also indicates the difference between the considerations in Yang et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JD028002) and the previous studies. In this reply, we present a detailed explanation to the readers of the difference between these considerations.
